## 🎯 Overview

**SaleSync** is a Java application designed as a simple store manager system. It serves as a practical demonstration of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** and related Java features as required by the **IIC 1153 - Object Oriented Programming** 

The system addresses a practical business or operational problem faced by a local startup company by providing solutions for:
- **Employee Management**
- **Product Inventory Management**
- **Billing System**

### Key Demonstrations

* 🏗️ **OOP Principles**: Application of **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**
* 📚 **Java Concepts**: Use of **Interfaces & Packages**, **Collections & Generics**, **File Handling**, and **Exception Handling**
* 🗄️ **Data Persistence**: Integration with **MongoDB** for data storage (implied file handling for data).
* 🖥️ **User Interface**: Implementation of a **JavaFx GUI**.
* 👥 **Version Control**: Effective use of **Git/GitHub** for collaborative development

## ⚡ Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up and run the SaleSync application:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```powershell
git clone [https://github.com/banuka20431/SaleSync.git](https://github.com/banuka20431/SaleSync.git)

cd SaleSync
```

### 2️⃣ Build the Project
Use Maven to compile the code and package the application:

```PowerShell
mvn clean package
```
### 3️⃣ Run the Application
You can run the application using the Maven exec plugin:

```PowerShell
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.oop_project.Main"

### 💻 Usage

The application will launch the JavaFx GUI upon execution. You will first be prompted to log in. A default Admin user is created on the first run for initial access.

**Features Access**

- Admin: Full access to Employee and Product Management.
- Product Manager: Access to Product Inventory Management.
- Cashier: Access to the Billing System.

### 🤝 Contributing (VCS Demo)

As a collaborative group assignment, effective use of Git and GitHub is mandatory to demonstrate teamwork.

Follow these steps to ensure proper Version Control System (VCS) usage:

Work on a Feature Branch: Create a new branch for every task to isolate changes and allow for merging demonstrations.

```Bash
git checkout -b feature/implement-login
```

Commit Regularly: Commit your changes frequently with descriptive commit messages.

```Bash
git commit -m "FEAT: Added basic validation logic to LoginController"
```

Push to GitHub: Keep the collaborative project repository updated.

```Bash
git push origin feature/implement-login
```

Open and Merge a PR: Use Pull Requests (PRs) on GitHub to merge your branch back into main once the feature is complete and reviewed.
